    Stori project:
        A cityâ€™s skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed
        from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape
        photo (Input), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Output)
        Input:
            [Li, Ri, Hi] = where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building and Hi
            is the height. Assume that all the buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat
            surface at height 0.
        Output:
            List of key points (red dots in the output figure) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2,y2] ] that uniquely
            defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment.
        Keep in mind:
            The output list must be sorted by the X position and there must be no consecutive horizontal
            lines of equal height in the output skyline.

    Inputs:
        Building N = [left_edge, right_edge, height]
        Building 1 = [2, 9, 10]
        Building 2 = [3, 6, 15]
        Building 3 = [5, 12, 12]
        Building 4 = [13, 16, 10]
        Building 5 = [15, 17, 5]
